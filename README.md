# Project : Introduction
As an avid food lover you decide to build a recipe application for those moments where the classics just wonâ€™t cut it. The application should allow users to search for a recipe and allow them to keep a list of their favourites.

# MobileRecipeApp
As part of the internship, I was tasked with a December project app which would bring together all the concepts, frameworks, architecture and principles I have recently learnt and worked with.

# Welcome to Chefs'pert... 
Chefs'pert, the expert chef or the chefs lil expert!

Chefspert is the perfect companion for anyone looking to be a chef in their home or any chef using it as an aid, it will give you access to a bunch
of recipes, with ingredients and steps on how to make the dishes. 
Filter through and find the perfect meal to start, continue or end your day.

For the meantime, the mobile application will be started off in the SwifUI framework.
